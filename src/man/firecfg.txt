.SH NAME
Firecfg \- Desktop configuration program for Firejail software.
.SH SYNOPSIS
firecfg [OPTIONS]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Firecfg is the desktop configuration utility for Firejail software. The utility
creates several symbolic links to firejail executable in /usr/local/bin.

Firecfg also checks .desktop files in /usr/share/applications/, 
replaces the full path by program name, and writes the  result to $HOME/.local/share/applications/.
This allows the user to sandbox applications automatically, just by clicking on regular desktop
menus and icons.

For more information, see \fBDESKTOP INTEGRATION\fR section in \fBman 1 firejail\fR.
