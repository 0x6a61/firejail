.SH NAME
Firecfg \- Desktop integration utility for Firejail software.
.SH SYNOPSIS
firecfg [OPTIONS]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Firecfg is the desktop integration utility for Firejail sandbox. 
It allows the user to sandbox applications automatically by
clicking on desktop manager icons and menus.

The integration covers:
.br
.PP
.RS
- programs started in a terminal - typing "firefox" would be enough to start a sandboxed Firefox browser
.br

.br
- programs started by clicking on desktop manager menus - all major desktop managers are supported
.br

.br
- programs started by clicking on file icons in file manager - only Cinnamon, KDE, LXDE, MATE and XFCE
desktop managers are supported in this moment
.RE

This brings us as very close to full desktop integration.

To set it up, run "sudo firecfg" after installing
Firejail software, and logout/login for the integration to take effect. "sudo firecfg" should also be run after
you install new programs. If the program is supported by Firejail, the symbolic link in /usr/local/bin
will be created. For a list of programs supported by default run "ls /etc/firejail".

For user-driven manual integration, see \fBDESKTOP INTEGRATION\fR section in \fBman 1 firejail\fR.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-\-clean
Remove all firejail symbolic links.
.TP
\fB\-\-fix-sound
Create a proper ~/.config/pulse/client.conf file without shm support. On some PulseAudio versions,
shared memory support (shm) breaks the process ID namespace. PulseAudio software was designed
a long time ago, and the introduction of PID namespace in Linux kernel breaks their design. This was
reportedly fixed in PulseAudio version 9. If you have sound problems on your system, run
"firecfg --fix-sound" command in a terminal, followed by logout/login in order to apply the changes.
.TP
\fB\-\-debug
Print debug messages.
.TP
\fB\-?\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Print options end exit.
.TP
\fB\-\-list
List all firejail symbolic links
.TP
\fB\-\-version
Print program version and exit.
