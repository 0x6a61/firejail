.SH NAME
profile \- Security profile file syntax for Firejail

.SH USAGE
.TP
firejail \-\-profile=filename.profile

.SH DESCRIPTION
Several Firejail command line configuration options can be passed to the program using
profile files. 
Firejail chooses a security profile in the following order:

1. If a profile is provided by the user with --profile option, the profile is loaded.
Example:
.PP
.RS
$ firejail --profile=/home/netblue/icecat.profile icecat
.RE

2. If a profile file with the same name as the application is present in ~/.config/firejail directory or
in /etc/firejail, the profile is loaded. ~/.config/firejail takes precedence over /etc/firejail. Example:
.PP
.RS
$ firejail icecat
.br
Command name #icecat#
.br
.br
Found icecat profile in /home/netblue/.config/firejail directory
.br
Reading profile /home/netblue/.config/firejail/icecat.profile
.br
[...]
.RE

3. Use the default profile in /etc/firejail/generic.profile. This can be disabled with --noprofile. Example:
.PP
.RS
$ firejail \-\-noprofile
.br
Parent pid 8553, child pid 8554
.br
Child process initialized
.br
$ exit
.br
.br
parent is shutting down, bye...
.br
$ firejail
.br
Reading profile /etc/firejail/generic.profile
.br
Parent pid 8553, child pid 8554
.br
Child process initialized
.br
$ 
.RE

.SH Scripting
Include and comment support:

.TP
\f\include other.profile exclude-token
Include other.profile file. exclude-token disables blacklist commands in other.profile
if exclude-token word is found in the name section of blacklist command.
exclude-token is optional.

Example: "include /etc/firejail/disable-common.inc .filezilla"
loads disable-common.inc file disables "blacklist ${HOME}/.filezilla" command in this file.

other.profile file name can be prefixed with ${HOME}. This will force Firejail to look for the
file in user home directory.

Example: "include ${HOME}/myprofiles/profile1" will load "~/myprofiles/profile1" file.

.SH Filesystem
These profile entries define a chroot filesystem built on top of the existing
host filesystem. Each line describes a file element that is removed from
the filesystem (\fBblacklist\fR), a read-only file or directory (\fBread-only\fR),
a tmpfs mounted on top of an existing directory (\fBtmpfs\fR),
or mount-bind a directory  or file on top of another directory or file (\fBbind\fR).
Use \fBprivate\fR to set private mode.
File globbing is supported, and PATH and HOME directories are searched.
Examples:
.TP
\f\blacklist /usr/bin
Remove /usr/bin directory.
.TP
\f\blacklist /etc/password
Remove /etc/password file.
.TP
\f\read-only /etc/password
Read-only /etc/password file.
.TP
tmpfs /etc
Mount an empty tmpfs filesystem on top of /etc directory.
.TP
bind /root/config/ssh,/etc/ssh
Mount-bind /root/config/ssh on /etc/ssh.
.TP
\f\blacklist /usr/bin/gcc*
Remove all gcc files in /usr/bin (file globbing).
.TP
\f\blacklist ${PATH}/ifconfig
Remove ifconfig command from the regular path directories.
.TP
\f\blacklist ${HOME}/.ssh
Remove .ssh directory from user home directory.
.TP
\f\private
Mount new /root and /home/user directories in temporary
filesystems. All modifications are discarded when the sandbox is
closed.
.TP
\f\private directory
Use directory as user home.
.TP
\f\private-home file,directory
Build a new user home in a temporary
filesystem, and copy the files and directories in the list in the
new home. All modifications are discarded when the sandbox is
closed.
.TP
\f\private-dev
Create a new /dev directory. Only null, full, zero, tty, pts, ptmx, random, urandom and shm devices are available.
.TP
\f\private-etc file,directory
Build a new /etc in a temporary
filesystem, and copy the files and directories in the list.
All modifications are discarded when the sandbox is closed.

.SH Filters
\fBcaps\fR and \fBseccomp\fR enable Linux capabilities and seccomp filters. Examples:

.TP
caps
Enable default Linux capabilities filter.
.TP
caps.drop all
Blacklist all Linux capabilities.
.TP
caps.keep capability,capability,capability
Blacklist Linux capabilities filter.
.TP
caps.drop capability,capability,capability
Whitelist Linux capabilities filter.
.TP
\f\seccomp
Enable default seccomp filter.  The default list is as follows:
mount, umount2, ptrace, kexec_load, open_by_handle_at, init_module, finit_module, delete_module,
iopl, ioperm, swapon, swapoff, syslog, process_vm_readv and process_vm_writev,
sysfs,_sysctl, adjtimex, clock_adjtime, lookup_dcookie, perf_event_open, fanotify_init and kcmp.
.TP
\f\seccomp syscall,syscall,syscall
Enable seccomp filter and blacklist the system calls in the list on top of default seccomp filter.
.TP
\f\seccomp.drop syscall,syscall,syscall
Enable seccomp filter and blacklist  the system calls in the list.
.TP
\f\seccomp.keep syscall,syscall,syscall
Enable seccomp filter and whitelist the system calls in the list.


.SH User Namespace
Use \fBnoroot\fR to enable an user namespace. The namespace has only one user, the current user.
There is no root account defined in the namespace.

.TP
noroot
Enable an user namespace without root user defined.


.SH Resource limits
These profile entries define the limits on system resources (rlimits) for the processes inside the sandbox.
The limits can be modified inside the sandbox using the regular \fBulimit\fR command. Examples:

.TP
\f\rlimit-fsize 1024
Set the maximum file size that can be created by a process to 1024 bytes.
.TP
\f\rlimit-nproc 1000
Set the maximum number of processes that can be created for the real user ID of the calling process to 1000.
.TP
\f\rlimit-nofile 500
Set the maximum number of files that can be opened by a process to 500.
.TP
\f\rlimit-sigpending 200
Set the maximum number of processes that can be created for the real user ID of the calling process to 200.

.SH CPU Affinity
Set the CPU cores available for this sandbox. Examples:

.TP
cpu 1,2,3
Use only CPU cores 0, 1 and 2.

.SH Control Groups
Place the sandbox in an existing control group specified by the full path of the task file. Example:

.TP
cgroup /sys/fs/cgroup/g1/tasks
The sandbox is placed in g1 control group.

.SH User Environment

.TP
env LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/test/lib
Set environment variable.
.br
Examples:
.br

.br
env LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/test/lib
.br
env CFLAGS="-W -Wall -Werror"

.TP
nogroups
Disable supplementary user groups
.TP
shell none
Run the program directly, without a shell.

.SH Networking
Networking features available in profile files.

.TP
netfilter
If a new network namespace is created, enabled default network filter.

.TP
netfilter filename
If a new network namespace is created, enabled the network filter in filename.

.TP
net none
Enable  a new, unconnected network namespace. The only interface
available in the new namespace is a new loopback interface (lo).
Use  this  option  to deny network access to programs that don't
really need network access.
